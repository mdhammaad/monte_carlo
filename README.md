# Monte Carlo Simulation – Random Variable Estimation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Monte Carlo simulation** in Python, showcasing how random sampling can be used to estimate values, probabilities, or model uncertainty.  
The notebook `monte_carlo.ipynb` provides a clear and practical example of generating random variables, running simulations, and visualizing outcomes.
Monte Carlo methods are widely used in **finance**, **data science**, and **risk analysis** for approximating results when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible.

## Objectives
Understand the concept of Monte Carlo simulations.  
Generate random variables and compute statistical properties.  
Visualize random distributions and simulation results using Python.  
Demonstrate reproducible experiments through controlled random seeds.

## Key Concepts
Random Number Generation  
Probability Distributions  
Statistical Estimation  
Simulation Repetition and Convergence
